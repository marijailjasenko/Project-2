### Project 2: Unit economics calculator for streaming service

**To-Dos:** 

1.Calculation of product's unit economics

2.Calculator and scenario for reaching 25% margin 

3.Visualisation

In this project I calculated unit economics for streaming service based on historical data and made automatic calculator for future scenario prognosis. All the calculations and visualisation were performed in Excel. 

During the analysis and calculation it became clear that unit economics metrics are highly affected by high costs in the first 2 months of the product's entry into the market and that's why average margin for the retrospective period is negative. To reacg 25% margin it is necessary to increse marketing costs due to new are attracted through active advertising.
